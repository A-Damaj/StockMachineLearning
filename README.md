# Stock Machine Learning Code

This Python code is used for predicting stock prices using machine learning. It includes data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.

## Required Libraries

- pandas
- warnings
- matplotlib
- numpy
- sklearn
- datetime

## How to Use

1. Save the stock data in a CSV file.Clone the repository and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

2. Open the code in your favorite editor.

3. Replace "InsertName.csv" with the name of the csv file containing the stock data.

4. Run the code in a Python environment.


## Data Preprocessing

The data is loaded from the CSV file using pandas. Any rows with missing data are removed. The dates are then converted to integers representing the number of days since January 1, 2010.

## Model Selection

Three models are chosen: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Time Series Split is used to split the data into training and testing sets. Each model is trained using the training data and evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE). The model with the lowest MSE is chosen as the best model.

## Results

The best model is trained using the entire training data and used to make predictions on the test data. The predicted stock prices are then plotted against the actual stock prices using matplotlib.

The predicted stock price for the next month is also displayed.


## Improvements

# The code can be improved by: 

Using more advanced machine learning algorithms such as deep learning.

Using more features in the model such as volume and price.

Tuning the hyperparameters of the model to improve performance.

Improving the data visualization to make it more intuitive and informative.

Using more advanced techniques for data preprocessing such as feature scaling.

##Conclusion
This code is a good starting point for anyone interested in predicting stock prices using machine learning algorithms. It can be improved and customized to fit specific use cases.



## Usage Notes

This code is for educational purposes only and should not be used for making real-world financial decisions. The accuracy of the predictions may be affected by factors outside the scope of the model, such as market conditions and geopolitical events.
